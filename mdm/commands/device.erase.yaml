    This key defines the fallback behavior for erasing a device.
    In macOS 12 and later, this command uses Erase All Content and Settings (EACS) on Mac computers with the Apple M1 chip or the Apple T2 Security Chip. On those devices, if EACS can't run, the device can use obliteration (macOS 11.x behavior). This key has no effect on machines prior to the T2 chip. For a list of supported macs, see Mac models with the Apple T2 Security Chip <https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862>.
    Upon receiving this command, the device performs preflight checks to determine if the device is in a state that allows EACS. The 'status' of the EraseDeviceResponse is either 'Acknowledged' or 'Error'.
    The following values define the device's fallback behavior:

    'DoNotObliterate':
    If EACS preflight fails, the device responds to the server with an 'Error' status and doesn't attempt to erase itself.
    If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, then the device doesn't attempt to erase itself.

    'ObliterateWithWarning':
    If EACS preflight fails, the device responds with an 'Acknowledged' status and then attempts to erase itself.
    If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, then the device attempts to erase itself.

    'Always':
    The system doesn't attempt EACS. T2 and later devices always obliterate.

    'Default':
    If EACS preflight fails, the device responds to the server with an 'Error' status and then attempts to erase itself.
    If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, then the device attempts to erase itself.
